Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 29 November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how this WhatsApp Business Notification Tool (“Notification Service”) handles data. The Application is intended solely for my personal use and is not provided as a service to the public.

1. Purpose of the Application

This Application is a personal tool that sends WhatsApp notifications to my own WhatsApp number. Notifications are triggered through URLs that I generate.
No external users interact with or use this Application.

2. Information Processed

The Application processes only the minimum data required to send notifications:

2.1 Personal Data

My own WhatsApp phone number — used only for receiving messages sent by the Application.

2.2 Notification Data

Message content included in the URL trigger (e.g., alert text, IDs, status messages).

The Application does not collect, store, or process personal data about any other individuals.

3. Data Storage

The Application does not permanently store notification content or personal data.

Any temporary data required for message sending exists only in memory or short-term logs (if server logging is enabled).

No analytics, tracking tools, or databases are used.

4. Data Sharing

The Application does not share data with any third parties except:

WhatsApp / Meta Platforms — as required to deliver messages through the WhatsApp Business API.

No data is shared with advertisers, marketers, or external companies.

5. Security

While this Application is for personal use, I take reasonable steps to keep the environment secure, including:

Restricting access to the repository and hosting environment.

Using secure connections (HTTPS) where possible.

Avoiding storage of sensitive data in the codebase.

6. Third-Party Services

The Application relies on the WhatsApp Business API, which is governed by Meta’s privacy and data-handling policies.
Users (if any) should refer to WhatsApp’s official Privacy Policy for details.

7. No Public Users

Since the Application is not intended for public use, it:

Does not collect data from external individuals.

Does not provide user accounts or access.

Does not offer any user-facing features.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be committed to this repository with an updated date above.
